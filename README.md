Multiplayer Checkers game made with PhaserJS, React, NestJS, SocketIO (TypeScript).
We guys did this for a bet company here in Brazil, but we got scammed and did not get paid, so we decided to turn it open source.

It's incomplete in a lot of features for bet purpouses, but it's primary gameplay is working nice with some know bugs that you can check in repository's issues, all the gameplay rule features are server-authoritative and processed inside of it.
